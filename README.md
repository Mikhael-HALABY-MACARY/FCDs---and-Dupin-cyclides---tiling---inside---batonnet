# FCDs---and-Dupin-cyclides---tiling---inside---batonnet
Python software to reproduce tiling of ellipses as well as the shape of the smectic layers taking the well-known shape of Dupin cyclides within a particular bâtonnet area 
at the Isotropic / Smectic A phase transition of 10CB liquid crystal.

Abstract: In this work, we are interested in the nucleation of bâtonnets at the Isotropic / Smectic
A phase transition of 10CB liquid crystal. Very often these bâtonnets are decorated with a large
number of focal conics. We present here an example of a bâtonnet obtained by optical crossed
polarized microscopy in a frequently observed particular area of the sample. This bâtonnet
presents bulges and one of them consists of a tessellation of ellipses. These ellipses are two by
two tangent one to each other and their confocal hyperbolas merge at the apex of the bâtonnet.
We propose a numerical simulation with Python software to reproduce this tiling of ellipses as
well as the shape of the smectic layers taking the well-known shape of Dupin cyclides within this
particular bâtonnet area.
